/**
 * Event key is a global index for an event stream.
 *
 * It is hex-encoded BCS bytes of `EventHandle` `guid` field value, which is
 * a combination of a `uint64` creation number and account address (without
 * trimming leading zeros).
 *
 * For example, event key `0x000000000000000088fbd33f54e1126269769780feb24480428179f552e2313fbe571b72e62a1ca1` is combined by the following 2 parts:
 * 1. `0000000000000000`: `uint64` representation of `0`.
 * 2. `88fbd33f54e1126269769780feb24480428179f552e2313fbe571b72e62a1ca1`: 32 bytes of account address.
